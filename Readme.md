Introduction
========

This is a distributed python QA system based on mongoDB.

ToDo
=============

* Implement a research paper writer on top of the crawler QA system
* Create a monitoring API in node.js that runs on each worker and provides a TCP endpoint API for requesting status data, memory, cpu, etc...
* Persist all queries ever performed, i.e. make all queries searchable, and use as cache.
* Clean up search and print time it took
